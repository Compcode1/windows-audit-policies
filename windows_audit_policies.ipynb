    "This project aims to redesign Windows audit policy configurations to reduce log noise and enhance detection clarity within Splunk. The objective is to produce a streamlined, purposeful audit policy that supports effective threat detection, baselining, and investigative workflows in a lab or SOC simulation environment. The work is driven by operational findings from previous log analysis and seeks to align audit settings with actual detection value.\n",

    "The previous Splunk-based project revealed a key operational challenge: the volume and frequency of Windows Security events made it difficult to isolate suspicious activity from routine background processes. While useful security data was present, it was buried in a flood of high-verbosity logs that hindered rapid triage and detection.\n",

    " **1. Document Which Audit Changes Led to Meaningful Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most impactful changes were:\n",
    "- **Disabling high-noise events** such as Process Termination (4689), which dramatically reduced overall log volume and simplified event review.\n",
    "- **Retaining only high-value audit categories** (Logon/Logoff, Account Management, Detailed Tracking for Process Creation, Privilege Use), ensuring all critical detection scenarios (logon, failed logon, privilege escalation, process creation, account changes) remained visible in Splunk.\n",
    "- **Adding network connection auditing** (Filtering Platform Connection), if enabled, for enhanced visibility of lateral movement attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in a **much cleaner event stream**â€”making it far easier to identify meaningful security activity while minimizing analysis fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **2. Identify Any Remaining Noise or Data Gaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remaining Noise:**  \n",
    "  Routine system and Splunk service activity still generates some 4688 (Process Creation) and 4624 (Service Logon) events, but the overall volume is manageable and expected for a baseline system.\n",
    "- **Data Gaps:**  \n",
    "  All key detection signals tested (logon successes and failures, group membership changes, process launches, scheduled task creation) were successfully captured and visible in Splunk. No significant detection gaps were observed in this lab scenario.\n",
    "- **Caveat:**  \n",
    "  If future detection requires detailed monitoring of specific files, services, or registry keys, targeted Object Access auditing (SACLs) may be neededâ€”currently out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " **3. Output: Final Recommendation for Lab or Production Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **This optimized audit policy provides a strong foundation** for SOC or lab-based detection workflows, balancing visibility and log volume for efficient Splunk analysis.\n",
    "- Further improvements could include periodic policy review, tailoring process tracking to known risk areas, or adding object access auditing only for highly sensitive assets.\n",
    "- For most environments, these settings should serve as a practical baseline. Adjustments can be made as real-world use uncovers new detection needs or sources of unnecessary noise.\n",
